/*
  SD card file dump

 This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
 SD library and send it over the serial port.

 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin PB15
 ** MISO - pin PB14
 ** CLK  - pin PB13
 ** CS   - pin PB12

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
  File dataFile = SD.open("datalog.txt");

  // if the file is available, write to it:
  if (dataFile) {
    while (dataFile.available()) {
